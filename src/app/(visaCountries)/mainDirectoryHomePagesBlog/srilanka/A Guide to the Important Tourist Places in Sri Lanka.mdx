## Discovering Important Tourist Places in Sri Lanka

### 1. Colombo

The major city, Colombo, is the main way to get to other parts of Sri Lanka. There are both old and new buildings there, including British ones and more modern ones. Some important places to visit are the busy Pettah Market, the peaceful Gangaramaya Temple, and the historic Galle Face Green, which is a favourite spot for families and foodies who like to eat street food.

### 2. Nuwara Eliya

Nuwara Eliya is in the middle of Sri Lanka's tea country. It is often called "Little England" because of its colonial buildings and cool weather. People can take tours of the lush tea farms, check out the Hakgala Botanical Gardens, or take a relaxing boat ride on Gregory Lake.

### 3. Kandy

Kandy is a city with a lot of history and culture. It is famous for the Temple of the Tooth, which holds the holy tooth relic of Buddha. The lively Esala Perahera holiday in this city is also famous for its historic procession with dancers, jugglers, musicians, fire breathers, and elephants that are very well decorated.

### 4. Mirissa

The beaches in Mirissa are beautiful, and this place is known as one of the best places in the world to see whales. There are a lot of beach parties and bars that light up the shore at night, making for a busy scene.

### 5. Arugam Bay

If you like to surf, Arugam Bay has some of the best breaks in the world. Young people like the laid-back vibe and the rustic lodgings. People who don't surf can go on walks of the lagoon, take yoga classes, or go on safaris to the nearby Kumana National Park.

This old city is in the Cultural Triangle and was once a busy centre in the Middle Ages. It is now a well-kept archaeological park with hundreds of tombs, churches, statues, and stupas that were built a long time ago.

### 8. Sinharaja Palace

One of Sri Lanka's ancient capitals, Anuradhapura, is famous for the well-preserved ruins of a Sinhala culture that lived a long time ago. Buddhists see the city as holy, and there are temples all around it that cover more than 40 square kilometres.

### 9. Hikkaduwa

People love Hikkaduwa for its beaches, coral gardens, and lively nightlife. The clear water is great for snorkelling and diving, or people can just relax on the beaches.
