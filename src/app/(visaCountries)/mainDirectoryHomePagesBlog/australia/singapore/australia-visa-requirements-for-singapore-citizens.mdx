Singaporean citizens planning to travel to Australia are required to obtain a visa prior to their journey. Some visas can be applied for online, while others necessitate a visit to the Australian Visa Application Center (AVAC) in Singapore. If you qualify for an Australia Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) for Singaporeans and have met all the prerequisites, you can proceed with the online application.

To determine your eligibility for an Australia ETA, you can utilise the 'Check Visa Requirement' tool provided by eVisa. The results are generated promptly, providing you with the necessary information.

## Documents Required for eVisa Application Process

<LinkText />
While the online application process has simplified visa acquisition for Singaporeans,
it still requires the submission of certain documents. Before you begin filling out
the application form, it is advisable to gather all the necessary documents. An eVisa
application in 2024 requires the following two from you:

**Valid Passport:** Singaporeans cannot travel to Australia without a passport. If you possess a passport, ensure that it remains valid for at least three months from your intended date of entry into Australia.

**Payment Options:** During the application process, you will be required to pay eVisa.com's service fees. You can make the payment using your credit or debit card.

**Note:** You will also be required to have a valid email address and answer a few standard questions, such as the purpose of your travel. While these questions are not overly complex, it is important to answer them honestly.

Once you have the aforementioned documents, you can commence the application process. The process is straightforward, and eVisa offers excellent customer support services that are available 24/7.

## Visa Processing Time for Singaporeans

The time taken to process a visa varies for each country. eVisa can process travel visas in as little as a day. We offer three processing times, and as expected, the faster you want your ETA, the more you pay. Here are your options:

**Standard Processing:** This is the most affordable and popular option. Your application will be processed within 24 to 48 business hours.

**Rush Processing:** This option is faster than the first. Your Australia ETA will be ready in just 24 hours, but it comes at a higher cost.

**Super Rush Processing:** This is the fastest option offered by eVisa. Your application will be ready in just 4 hours.

## Passport Validity for Travel to Australia

Most countries require that a passport be valid for at least 6 months from the date of arrival in the country. If your passport expires sooner than that, you should apply to renew your passport. If your passport is set to expire, eVisa can assist you.

## Application Process for Australia ETA for Singaporeans

The application form is simple and can be completed quickly. It is divided into two easy steps:

**First:** You will be asked to fill in your personal information as it appears on your passport and choose the processing time.

**Second:** You will be asked to review your application information, correct any errors if found, and then make the payment. After that, you can submit your application along with the fees.

**Third:** Obtaining an Australia ETA via email for Singaporeans is one of the simplest tasks you can undertake. It requires minimal time and effort, and you will be ready for your journey in no time. It is certainly a more convenient process compared to visiting an embassy for a Consular visa.

## Different Types of Australian ETA

Other types of ETAs for different nationalities and purposes, although they likely wouldn't be relevant to Singaporean citizens on a casual trip.

Some examples of these ETAs are:

**1.Subclass 601 ETA for Specific Countries:** This applies to citizens of certain countries eligible for shorter trips beyond 90 days (up to 12 months) for specific purposes like family visits or research.

**2.Subclass 651 eVisitor:** This is a simpler authorization for stays up to 3 months for specific nationalities, including some neighbouring countries to Singapore.

**3.Work and Holiday ETAs:** These are separate categories (Subclass 417 and 462) allowing limited work during tourist stays for eligible applicants.

**Note:** These are just a few examples, and the options and eligibility criteria can vary depending on nationality and travel goals. So, if you'd like to dig deeper into specific types of ETAs, please provide more context about your nationality and intended travel to Australia. This will allow our eVisa experts to tailor the information on our website as per your needs.
