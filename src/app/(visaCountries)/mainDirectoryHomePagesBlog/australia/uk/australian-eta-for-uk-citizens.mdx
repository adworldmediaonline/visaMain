## Apply for Australian eVisa and Hop on Your Most Awaited Journey to Australia Today!

If you are a UK citizen and you want to visit Australia for tourism or business purposes, you do not need a paper or stamp visa to enter the country. However, you do need to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) before your arrival. This e-Visa is also known as the eVisitor visa, and it allows you to stay in Australia for short periods of time, up to 90 days per visit. We are here to help you with this process.

The first thing you need to check before entering Australia is whether you need an Australia e-Visitor. If you are from the United Kingdom, then you are eligible to get an Australia e-Visitor, which is good news for you because this way you can save a lot of time for your trip. All UK citizens must get a valid visa, or Electronic Travel Authority (ETA), in advance to be admitted to Australia.

The Australian Tourist Visa is valid for leisure/tourism-related travel. It is valid for 12 months and allows multiple entries (a continuous stay of 90 days per visit). It is not valid for paid work or extended study.

## Things You Need to Know About the Australian eVisa

The main point to know about the e-Visa is that it is an electronic travel authorization. This document is obtained through an online form that you can access here. The e-Visitor or the eVisa works with the Australian ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) system.

This visa-waiver system is approved for those citizens who do not need to get a Paper Visa to enter Australia, which is why the United Kingdom (the UK) is on the list. So, as a citizen of the UK, you need an Australian eVisitor to enter this beautiful country. This is required for your case, as you do not need a Paper Visa.

**Remember:** If you are living in the UK but you are not a citizen of this country, we recommend checking our visa checker first.
