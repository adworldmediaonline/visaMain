Getting the right travel papers is the first step in starting a trip to see Turkey's beautiful scenery and rich culture. Applying for a <LinkText text=" Turkey visa online" href="/tr/"/> through the e-visa system is what most people do. Many people who apply for e-visas are approved, but sometimes they are turned down, leaving travellers unsure of what to do next. This guide will show you how to reapply for a Turkey visa after being turned down the first time, so you can keep your trip plans on track.

## Understanding the Reasons for Rejecting a Visa

Before you renew, it's important to know the most common reasons why your Turkey visa application was turned down. Here are some of them:

-   Not enough or wrong details on the application form.
-   Based on past travels, place of origin, or age, there is a chance that the person is overstaying.
-   The e-visa does not cover the reason for the trip.
-   The passport was not good for the required 150 days at the time of entry.
-   The old visa is still good.

Finding out the exact reason your visa was denied can greatly improve your chances of being approved the next time you apply.

## How to apply for Turkish Visa

### 1. Go over your application again:

Carefully look over your old application to see if there are any mistakes or missing information. Make sure that all of the information on your passport and travel papers matches.

### 2. Fix Errors:

If your application was turned down because of mistakes, fix them. This could mean changing your personal information, making it clear why you want to journey, or making sure your passport meets the requirements for how long it can be used.

### 3. Get More papers:

Sometimes, adding more papers can make your application stronger. This could be a letter of invitation from someone in Turkey, proof that you have enough money, or a thorough plan of your stay.

### 4. Wait:

After being turned down for a visa, you have to wait 24 hours before you can try again. Now is the time to check your new application and papers one more time.

### 5. Reapply Online:

Fill out the Turkey e-visa application form online and send it in with your new application. Before you send it in, make sure that all of the information is correct and full.

### 6. Apply through an embassy:

If your e-visa is turned down again, you might want to try asking through the Turkish embassy or consulate that is closest to you. Talking to foreign staff directly may take longer, but they can explain the reason for the refusal and what you can do to make it better.

## FAQs

#### Q1. When you reapply for a Turkey visa, how long does it take to process?

A: Most applications for e-visas are handled between 24 and 72 hours. If you apply through an embassy, on the other hand, it might take longer, based on how many appointments they have open.

#### Q2: Can I get in touch with the Turkish government to find out why my visa was turned down?

A: Yes, calling the Turkish embassy or consulate closest to you can help you figure out why your visa was denied and give you tips on how to reapply.

#### Q3: Is it possible to get a visa the same day I meet with the embassy?

A: You might be able to get a visa the same day you go to the office as long as you have all the necessary paperwork and there are no problems with your application.

#### Q4: Will not getting a visa change my plans to travel in the future?

A: Not getting a visa once won't stop you from travelling. It may show up in your travel records, but if you correctly explain the reasons you were turned down on later applications, you can often be accepted.

#### Q5. How can I show that I really want to go back to my home country?

A: It can be very important to show that you have strong ties to your home country. This could include letters of employment, deeds to land, or proof of family ties. You need to show that you have strong reasons to come back.

#### Q6. What should I do if my passport isn't good for the length of time needed?

A: If your passport isn't still good 150 days after you plan to enter Turkey, you will need to get a new one before you can apply for another visa.

#### Q7. Should I apply for a Turkey visa in person or online if I'm not going there for work or pleasure?

A: The e-visa is mostly used for travel, work, or getting around. If you want to travel for other reasons, like to study or work, you should apply for the right visa at a Turkish office or consulate.

#### Q8. How much time do I need to give the visa filing process before my trip?

A: You should start the visa application process at least one month before you plan to journey. This is especially true if you are applying through an embassy. This is to allow for processing times and any delays that are out of your control.
