## 2: Difference Between National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries

Understanding the difference between national parks and wildlife sanctuaries is crucial for planning your visit.

### National Parks

National parks in India are areas designated for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats. They have strict regulations to ensure minimal human interference. Activities like hunting, poaching, and deforestation are prohibited. These parks focus on preserving the entire ecosystem, including flora, fauna, and geological features.

### Wildlife Sanctuaries

Wildlife sanctuaries also aim to protect wildlife with more relaxed regulations than national parks. Human activities such as grazing and firewood collection may be allowed in certain areas. The primary focus is on protecting specific species rather than the whole ecosystem.

### Key Differences

**Regulation:** National parks in India have stricter rules compared to wildlife sanctuaries.

**Objective:** National parks focus on preserving the entire ecosystem, while wildlife sanctuaries aim to protect specific species.
