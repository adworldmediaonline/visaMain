# Australia to India: Top 30 Things To Do In India for Fun!

India is an overwhelming sensory experience in the best way possible. It's vast and diverse, offering something for everyone. Hence, preparation is key, but don't be afraid to embrace the unexpected.

Our comprehensive guide provides top 30 insider tips for Aussie's unforgettable trip to India.

Here's the list of top 30 things that you can do in India as an Australian:

**1.Plan your trip around the seasons**

India has a diverse climate and different regions have different weather patterns. The southwest monsoon brings rain from June to September, but this is a good time to visit Ladakh. The ideal time to travel is from October to May, but it can get very hot and humid from March onwards. The Himalayan foothills offer milder temperatures in the spring.

**2. Get your jabs before you travel**

You should contact a health professional at least eight weeks before you travel to get the recommended vaccinations, such as diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis A and B, polio, typhoid, and possibly Japanese B encephalitis, meningitis and rabies. There is no official requirement for vaccinations to enter India, except for yellow fever if you are coming from an endemic country.

**3. Take malaria precautions**

Depending on where you are going, you may need to take anti-malarial tablets and use mosquito repellents and nets. Malaria is more prevalent in the northeastern and eastern parts of India, as well as Mangalore.

**4. Pack light and smart**

You don’t need to bring a lot of clothes or toiletries, as you can easily buy them in India at cheap prices. However, you should pack some essentials, such as sunscreen, sunglasses, hat, scarf, comfortable shoes, water bottle, flashlight, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and a first aid kit. You should also bring a photocopy of your passport, visa, and travel insurance documents, and keep them separate from the originals.

**5. Dress modestly and respectfully**

India is a conservative country, and you should respect the local culture and customs by dressing appropriately. Avoid wearing revealing or tight-fitting clothes, especially in religious places, rural areas, and small towns. Women should cover their shoulders, chest, and knees, and men should avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless shirts. You may also want to carry a shawl or a sarong to cover your head or wrap around your waist when needed.

**6. Learn some basic Hindi phrases**

Although English is widely spoken in India, especially in urban areas and tourist spots, it is helpful to learn some basic Hindi phrases to communicate with the locals and show respect. Some useful words and expressions are: namaste (hello/goodbye), shukriya or dhanyavaad (thank you), haan or ji haan (yes), naheen (no), theek hai (okay/fine), aapka naam kya hai? (what is your name?), mera naam … hai (my name is …), aap kaise hain? (how are you?), main theek hoon (I am fine), mujhe … chahiye (I need …), kitna hai? (how much is it?), yeh kahaan hai? (where is this?), madad kijiye (help me), maaf kijiye (excuse me/sorry), and chalo (let’s go).

**7. Be prepared for culture shock**

India is a country of contrasts, and you may experience culture shock when you encounter the poverty, pollution, traffic, noise, crowds, and chaos that are part of everyday life. You may also witness some practices that may seem strange or shocking to you, such as open defecation, cow worship, caste discrimination, arranged marriages, and public displays of affection. Try to keep an open mind and a sense of humour, and don’t judge or criticise what you don’t understand. Remember that India is a diverse and complex country, and there is more to it than meets the eye.

**8. Respect the local etiquette and customs**

India has a rich and ancient culture, and you should be aware of some of the etiquette and customs that govern social interactions. For instance, you should always use your right hand to eat, greet, and give or receive anything, as the left hand is considered unclean. You should also avoid touching anyone’s head, feet, or shoes, as these are considered sacred or impure parts of the body. You should also remove your shoes before entering a temple, mosque, or someone’s home, and avoid pointing your feet or the soles of your shoes at anyone or anything. You should also refrain from eating beef, as cows are sacred to Hindus, and avoid drinking alcohol or smoking in public places, as these are frowned upon by many Indians.

**9. Be careful with the food and water**

India is famous for its delicious and diverse cuisine, but you should be careful with what you eat and drink, as you may get sick from contaminated food or water. You should avoid tap water, ice, raw fruits and vegetables, street food, and dairy products, unless you are sure they are safe. You should also stick to vegetarian dishes, as they are less likely to cause stomach problems. You should also carry some oral rehydration salts, antidiarrheal medication, and probiotics, in case you do get sick. You should also drink plenty of bottled water to stay hydrated, and avoid caffeine and spicy food, as they can dehydrate you further.

**10. Bargain hard but fairly**

Bargaining is a common and expected practice in India, especially in markets, shops, and with rickshaw drivers. You should always negotiate the price before you buy anything or take a ride, and don’t be afraid to walk away if you are not satisfied. However, you should also bargain hard but fairly, and not haggle over a few rupees, as this may offend the seller or driver. You should also remember that a few rupees may mean a lot more to them than to you, and that you are supporting the local economy by paying a reasonable price.

**11. Be wary of scams and touts**

India is a relatively safe country for travellers, but you should still be wary of scams and touts that may try to rip you off or take advantage of you. Some of the common scams and touts are: fake guides, fake tickets, fake money, fake gems, fake charities, fake taxis, fake hotels, fake tours, and fake beggars. You should always do your research, check the reviews, ask for official identification, and trust your instincts. You should also avoid giving money or gifts to beggars or children, as this may encourage them to continue begging or exploit them further. You should also be careful with your belongings, and keep them in a safe place or on your person at all times.

**12. Get a local SIM card and use apps**

India has a good and cheap network of mobile phones and internet, and you should get a local SIM card and use apps to make your travel easier and more convenient. You can get a SIM card at the airport or at any mobile shop, and you will need to provide a passport photo, a copy of your passport and visa, and fill out a form. You can then use apps such as Google Maps, Uber, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, MakeMyTrip, Cleartrip, IRCTC, and WhatsApp to navigate, book, order, and communicate with ease. You can also use apps such as Duolingo, Google Translate, and XE Currency to learn, translate, and convert languages and currencies.

**13. Travel by train**

India has one of the largest and most extensive railway networks in the world, and traveling by train is one of the best and most affordable ways to see the country. You can book your train tickets online through the IRCTC website or app, or through third-party websites or apps such as Cleartrip or MakeMyTrip.

People travelling to India can book their tickets at the railway station, but they may have to deal with long queues, confusing systems, and limited availability. Hence, you can choose from different classes of travel, such as AC, sleeper, chair car, or general, depending on your budget and comfort level. You should also check the train schedule, status, and platform number before you board, and arrive at least 30 minutes before departure. You should also carry some snacks, water, and entertainment, as train journeys can be long and unpredictable.

**14. Stay in a variety of accommodations **

India offers a wide range of accommodations, from luxury hotels and resorts to budget hostels and guesthouses, and you should stay in a variety of them to experience the different aspects of the country. You can book your accommodations online through websites or apps such as Booking.com, Agoda, Airbnb, Hostelworld, or Couchsurfing, or you can find them on the spot, depending on the season and availability. You can also stay in some unique and authentic accommodations, such as heritage hotels, homestays, ashrams, treehouses, houseboats, or tents, and enjoy the local hospitality, culture, and scenery.

**15. Visit the Taj Mahal and other iconic sights**

India is home to some of the most iconic and stunning sights in the world, and you should not miss them when you visit the country. The Taj Mahal, the symbol of love and one of the seven wonders of the world, is a must-see, and you should try to visit it at sunrise or sunset, when the light and crowds are less.

People can visit other famous sights, such as the Red Fort, the Qutub Minar, the Amber Fort, the Hawa Mahal, the Khajuraho Temples, the Ajanta and Ellora Caves, the Meenakshi Temple, the Mysore Palace, the Gateway of India, and the Victoria Memorial, among many others. You should also check the opening hours, entry fees, and dress codes of these sights before you visit them, and hire a guide or an audio guide if you want to learn more about their history and significance.

**16. Discover the diversity of India**

India is a country of diversity, and you should explore the different regions, cultures, languages, religions, cuisines, and landscapes that make up this incredible nation. You can visit the snow-capped Himalayas, the golden deserts, the lush jungles, the serene backwaters, the tropical beaches, and the vibrant cities, and experience the variety of climates, flora, and fauna.

You can also learn about the rich and diverse history, heritage, art, architecture, music, dance, literature, and festivals of India, and interact with the friendly and hospitable people.

You can also respect and appreciate the different faiths and beliefs, from Hinduism and Buddhism to Islam and Sikhism, and visit the sacred and beautiful temples, mosques, churches, and gurudwaras.

**17. Try some adventure activities**

India is not only a cultural and historical destination, but also an adventure lover’s paradise. You can try some thrilling and fun activities, such as trekking, rafting, skiing, paragliding, bungee jumping, zip-lining, scuba diving, surfing, and wildlife safaris, and get your adrenaline pumping. You can also explore some offbeat and unique places, such as the haunted forts, the living root bridges, the magnetic hill, the salt desert, and the floating lake, and experience the wonders of nature and science.

Tourists can also challenge themselves and push their limits, by taking on some of the toughest and highest routes, such as the Chadar Trek, the Roopkund Trek, the Khardung La Pass, and the Siachen Glacier, and feel a sense of achievement and awe.

**18. Be flexible and patient**

India is a country of surprises, and you should be flexible and patient when travelling in India, as things may not always go according to plan. You may face delays, cancellations, changes, or breakdowns in your transport, accommodation, or itinerary, and you may have to deal with bureaucracy, corruption, or inefficiency. You may also encounter some challenges, such as language barriers, cultural differences, or scams. You should not let these things ruin your trip, but rather take them in stride and adapt to the situation. You should also keep a positive attitude and a smile, and enjoy the journey as much as the destination. You should also remember that India is a developing country, and not expect the same standards or facilities as in your home country.

**Note** Be respectful and understanding of the local conditions and limitations, and not impose your expectations or preferences on them.

**19. Give back to the community**

India is a country of contrasts, and you may witness the stark gap between the rich and the poor, the urban and the rural, and the modern and the traditional. You may also see the social and environmental issues that affect the country, such as poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, pollution, deforestation, and climate change. You may feel moved or inspired to do something to help or make a difference, and you can do so by giving back to the community. You can volunteer with a reputable and ethical organisation, such as Teach for India, Goonj, Akshaya Patra, or WWF India, and contribute your time, skills, or resources to a cause that you care about.

Australian visitors can also donate to a local charity, school, or hospital, or support a social enterprise, such as Sikkim Organic, Barefoot College, or Fabindia, that empowers the local people and promotes sustainable development. You can also practise responsible tourism, by choosing eco-friendly and community-based accommodations, tours, and activities, and minimising your environmental and cultural impact.

**20. Have fun and enjoy yourself**

India is a country of joy, and you should have fun and enjoy yourself when travelling in India, as there is so much to see, do, and experience. You should immerse yourself in the colourful and vibrant culture, and join in the celebrations and festivities, such as Holi, Diwali, Dussehra, Eid, or Christmas, and have a blast.

They can also capture some memories and souvenirs, and take some photos, videos, or sketches, or buy some handicrafts, spices, or textiles, and cherish them for a lifetime.

**21. Be grateful and humble**

India is a country of grace, and you should be grateful and humble when travelling in India, as you are a guest in this land and you have the privilege and opportunity to explore and experience it. You should thank the people who help you, guide you, host you, or serve you, and show your appreciation and respect.

You should also acknowledge the challenges and hardships that many Indians face, and not take anything for granted or complain about minor inconveniences. You should also be humble and curious, and not act superior or arrogant, or assume that you know everything or better. You should also be open and willing to learn, and not impose your views or beliefs on others. You should also remember that you are representing your country and culture, and be a good ambassador and a responsible traveller.

**22. Fall in love with India**

India is a country of love, and you should fall in love with India when travelling in India, as it is a unique and magical place that will touch your heart and soul. You should embrace the beauty and the madness, the chaos and the order, the diversity and the unity, and the contrasts and the harmony that make up India. You should also discover the hidden gems and the offbeat places, and not just follow the tourist trail or the guidebook.

Aussies can also connect with the people and the stories, and not just see them as strangers or statistics. They can also find your own meaning and purpose, and not just follow the trends or the expectations.
