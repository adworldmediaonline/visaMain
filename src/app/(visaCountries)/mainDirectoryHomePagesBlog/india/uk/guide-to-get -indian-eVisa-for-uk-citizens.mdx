An Indian eVisa is an online travel authorization that enables Indian citizens to visit the UK for up to six months. The eVisa costs £60 and can be used for single or multiple trips, for any purpose, such as business, tourism, or family visits. Travellers from other countries who also want to go to the UK should consult their own embassy or consulate to find out how to get an Indian eVisa.

**2. Is it possible to go to India now?**

Yes, you can. But you have to apply for a new visa if you have one that was issued before October 2021, because it is not valid anymore. If you have a UK passport, it is easier to get a tourist visa now, because you can apply for an e-visa online.

However, if you are a British citizen with Pakistani roots, you have to get an Indian visa on a Pakistani passport, or show that you have given up or cancelled it. This may take a lot longer, about seven or eight weeks.

The India visa fee depends on the type of visa you choose. The e Visa fee for UK citizens is £64 USD, plus a bank charge of 2.5%. The regular visa fee varies depending on the duration and number of entries, and ranges from £112 to £472, plus a service charge of £7.44.

**5. What are the best places to visit in India?**

India is a huge and diverse country, with many amazing places to see and experience. It is hard to cover all of India in one trip, so most visitors choose to focus on one or more of the classic routes, or mix them up on a longer journey of two or three weeks. The most popular route is a circuit of Delhi, Agra (where the Taj Mahal is located) and cities in Rajasthan such as Jaipur and Udaipur, for a cultural and historical tour. If you prefer beaches and green scenery, Kerala is the highlight of southern India.

Other popular areas and themes to explore include seeing tigers and other wildlife in central Madhya Pradesh, or taking mountain trains and drinking tea in the Himalayan foothills. You can also find some hidden gems in less visited regions, such as cinematic Mumbai and spiritual Varanasi, or even Kolkata with its rich heritage. Some states, such as Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, are also overlooked by many foreigners. If you want to see a different side of India, you can travel to places like Nagaland with its tribal cultures, Sikkim on the edge of Tibet, or the remote and jungle-covered Andaman Islands.

## What should I remember when applying for an Indian eVisa?

Here are some tips to help you with the application process:

-   Have all the required documents with you before you start the application. This includes your passport, visa application form, and two photos that follow the visa rules.
-   Apply as soon as possible to get your Indian eVisa. The sooner you apply, the more likely you are to get a permit. But remember, there is no guarantee that you will get a visa, so be ready to provide more documents if needed.
-   Know that some cities in India may not be open to visitors with an Indian eVisa. If this is the case, make sure you know how else you can enter India, such as through a port of entry or a land route.
-   If you are travelling with a group, make sure everyone has filled out the visa application form and sent all the necessary documents in advance. This will help prevent any hold-ups during the processing time.
