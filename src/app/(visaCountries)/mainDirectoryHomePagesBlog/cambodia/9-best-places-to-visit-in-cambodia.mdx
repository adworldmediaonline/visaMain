Cambodia is full of ancient temples, lively culture, and beautiful scenery that make travelling there feel like stepping into a history book. Every place gives you a different view of Southeast Asia's heart. Here is a full list of some of the best places to visit in Cambodia

## 1. The Temple of Angkor Wat

Large temple complex known as Angkor Wat was constructed in the first part of the 1200s. It is regarded as one of Southeast Asia's most well-known locations. The location has become known for its magnificence and the superb architectural craftsmanship. Its total area exceeds 162 hectares. Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu, it eventually became a Buddhist shrine. The building, which appears on the national flag of Cambodia, is a representation of that nation. It may require multiple days to thoroughly investigate the complex. Two of the more interesting areas are the jungle-covered Ta Prohm and the Bayon Temple, which has numerous serene stone faces.

## 2. The Cambodian capital

Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, is a bustling hub for industry and politics. The vibrant coexistence of ancient and modern elements is evident in the bustling marketplaces and stunning palaces. Two of the city's top attractions are the National Museum, which has a sizable collection of Khmer art, and the Royal Palace, which is home to the stunning Silver Pagoda. The depressing Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum illustrates the brutality of the Khmer Rouge and is a must-see.

## 3. The Koh Rong Samloem

Koh Rong Samloem is the less busy cousin of Koh Rong and is perfect for people who want to get away to a peaceful beach paradise. People love this island because it has beautiful bays, clear water, and a more relaxed, unspoiled side of seaside life in Cambodia. Some things to do are snorkelling, diving, and just relaxing on the beach.

## 4. The city of Siem Reap

Not only is Siem Reap the way to get to Angkor Wat, but it's also a very interesting place to visit on its own. There are many places to shop, eat, and have fun in the city, especially around the popular Pub Street. The Cambodian Cultural Village and the many silk farms and art shops that make and sell traditional Cambodian goods are cultural highlights.

## 5. The Battambang

Battambang is Cambodia's second-largest city, but it is much quieter than Phnom Penh. It is known for its French colonial buildings and peaceful rural setting. Nearby, tourists can visit old temples, ride bamboo trains, and go on river tours. The city is also a starting point for trips into the countryside, which has traditional Cambodian towns and beautiful rice paddies.

## 6. SÃ©guinoukville

Sihanoukville is a well-known beach town known for its lively nightlife and beautiful beaches. It's a way to get to nearby islands, and people love to go water sports and eat fish there. Even though some changes have been made to the scenery recently, it is still a popular place for people to enjoy the beauty of Cambodia's coast.

## 7. The Krong Kampot

Kampot is a cute town with a laid-back vibe that is known for its pepper farms and beautiful views of the river. People can visit the colonial town centre, the pepper farms, or go on a river cruise at dusk to see fireflies. It's also close to Bokor National Park, which has beautiful views and trails that lead to old French colonial houses.

## 8. The Kratie

Kratie is a small town on the Mekong River. It is famous for being one of the last places you can see the critically endangered Irrawaddy dolphins in the wild. The town is located on a calm river, which makes it a great place to watch the sunset.

## 9. The Mondulkiri

One of the most beautiful parts of Cambodia is Mondulkiri, which has the fewest people but is known for its cooler weather, rolling hills, and thick woods. It's a great place to go hiking, meet local native people, and see elephants in protected areas. There are also waterfalls and coffee farms in the area.
