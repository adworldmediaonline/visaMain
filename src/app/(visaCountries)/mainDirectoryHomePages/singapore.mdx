### What Is Singapore eVisa?

The Singapore eVisa is a digital document that allows travelers from eligible nations to enter the country. It’s an electronic version of the traditional visa, making it more convenient as there is no need to visit an embassy or mail in your passport.

You should submit your personal information, trip details, and health declaration electronically within three days prior to the date of your arrival in Singapore. This can be done using the SG Arrival Card e-Service.

Note: The SG Arrival Card is not a visa and the use of the SG Arrival Card e-Service is free of charge.

Upon successful processing of your Singapore Visa Online Application, you will be issued a visa in the form of a PDF document.

Remember: Possession of a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. The grant of an immigration pass will be determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry.

For more detailed information, please visit the official website of the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) of Singapore.

We hope you enjoy your amazing trip to Singapore!

#### How to Apply Singapore VISA Online?

6. Check the status of your application: The SAVE system comes with a “Status Enquiry” function to enable the local contact or the applicant to check on the status of the Singapore Visa Online Application.
