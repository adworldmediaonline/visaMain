If you are a US citizen, you might think that travelling to Australia is a hassle, especially when it comes to getting a visa. But don’t worry, we have some good news for you. You can apply for an ETA, an electronic travel authorization, that will let you enter Australia for up to 90 days per visit, without needing a paper or stamp visa. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, it’s not.

Whether you want to dive the Great Barrier Reef, explore the Outback, or enjoy the cosmopolitan cities of Sydney and Melbourne, Australia has something for everyone. So, what are you waiting for? Let’s get started on your Aussie dream!

### What is an Australian ETA?

An Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) is an authorization to travel to and enter Australia, and it is electronically linked to your passport. It is for short stays for tourism or business visitor activities. Business visitor activities do not include work.

#### How does the Australian eVisa/ETA program work?

The ETA/eVisa system was implemented in 1996, providing official permission to visit Australia, and it is linked to your passport. When you check-in at the airport, the staff can simply confirm that you already have permission to travel to Australia.

With this eVisa, you can visit the country of Australia for a certain period, whether for tourism or business. With this ETA, you will avoid going to an embassy and wasting a lot of time.

## Getting an Australian eVisa or the ETA for US Citizens

Travelling to Australia from the US is not too difficult, as the two countries share a common language. Australia is a great destination for travellers of all kinds: families, couples, solo adventurers, and more. However, there are some rules to keep in mind regarding their visa process.

### Documents Needed for Your Australian eVisa:

Applying for an Australian ETA is very easy. Here's the list of documents you need to process your ETA application for Australia:

- **Valid passport:** The expiry date of your passport should be more than 6 months from your departure date.

- **Credit/Debit card or Online Payments Options:** It will be used for your application fees.

- **Working Email address:** We need a valid email address of yours because you will receive your visa on that email.
