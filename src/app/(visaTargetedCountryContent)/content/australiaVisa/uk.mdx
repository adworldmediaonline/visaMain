## Things You Need to Know About the Australian eVisa

The main point to know about the e-Visa is that it is an electronic travel authorization. This document is obtained through an online form that you can access here. The e-Visitor or the eVisa works with the Australian ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) system.

This visa-waiver system is approved for those citizens who do not need to get a Paper Visa to enter Australia, which is why the United Kingdom (the UK) is on the list. So, as a citizen of the UK, you need an Australian eVisitor to enter this beautiful country. This is required for your case, as you do not need a Paper Visa.

_**Remember:** If you are living in the UK but you are not a citizen of this country, we recommend checking our visa checker first._

### A List of Documents the Citizens of the UK Need for an Australian eVisa

To apply for an Australian e-Visitor visa, you need the following documents:

1. **Valid Passport**: Ensure your passport has at least 6 months of validity. You also need to scan the information page. Accepted formats include PNG, JPG, or JPEG.

2. **Supporting Documents**: The Australian government may require additional documents to prove your intention to stay in Australia as a tourist.

3. **Credit/Debit Card**: You can use either a credit or debit card for payments.

4. **Email Address**: Provide a valid email address to receive your e-Visitor via email.
