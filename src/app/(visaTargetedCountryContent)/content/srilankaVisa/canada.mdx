## Do I need a visa for Sri Lanka from Canada?

Canadian visitors planning to travel to Sri Lanka must obtain a visa, except for those intending to reside or work there, who need to apply for a regular visa at a Sri Lankan consulate.

For short-term visits, Canadians can apply for an ETA online, valid for 30 days. There are three types of ETA:

-   ## Tourist ETA: For leisure, family, medical, or cultural purposes.
-   ## Business ETA: For professional, commercial, or educational purposes.
-   ## Transit ETA: For transit through Sri Lanka for up to 2 days. Not required if transit time is under 8 hours and the traveler remains in the airport.

The tourist and business ETA can be extended for up to 6 months, provided the visa has not expired.

The online ETA application process is quick and straightforward, typically taking a few minutes to fill out and a few hours to process. Standard delivery time is 1 to 2 business days, with a priority option guaranteeing the ETA in 1 hour.

## How long does it take for Canadians to get a Sri Lankan ETA?

To avoid delays, Canadians should apply for the ETA at least 2 business days before their trip. The ETA will be emailed and requires no paperwork or airport queues, making it more convenient than obtaining a regular visa from a Sri Lankan embassy or consulate.

## How do I apply for a Sri Lanka Visa for Canadian citizens?
