### Understanding Visa Application Procedure

Prior to departing Kenya for India, one is required to have an in-depth knowledge of and effectively manage the visa procedures. India's historical monuments, varied cultures, and expansive landscapes make it a popular destination for tourists, business travellers, and individuals seeking medical treatment. In order to facilitate the visa application procedure for Kenyan citizens seeking an Indian visa, VisaCollect is fully devoted to providing the necessary information and support. Everything you need to know about obtaining an India visa is detailed below.

#### Who Should Apply For a Visa to India?

**General Requirement:** All Kenyan citizens who desire to visit India must obtain a visa before visiting. India offers a wide range of visas to suit a variety of travel needs, including tourist visas, business visas, and medical visas.

**Visa Exemptions:** At current time, Kenyan citizens visiting India are not eligible for visa exemptions. Every Kenyan traveller must apply for a visa, unless they hold diplomatic or official passports, which may need other entrance procedures.

**Certain provisions apply to minors:** Additionally, Kenyan children and minors require a visa in order to enter India. On behalf of a minor, legal guardians or parents may register for the visa. Travelling with a parent or an additional adult requires the submission of appropriate documentation, such as a copy of the birth certificate of the child and letters of consent.

##### Required Documents for Visa Applications

The documentation required to apply for an Indian visa varies according to the class of visa. However, frequently required documents include:

- Passport: A valid Kenyan passport with two vacant pages for stamps, which must be six months or longer from your point of arrival in India.
- Photograph: A recent passport-sized image that meets the requirements for Indian visa photos.
- Application Form: An appropriately filled out and signed request for a visa.
- Flight Itinerary: A validated round-trip itinerary or ticket to India that comprises both the arrival and departure points.
- Supporting Documentation: Reservations for hotels or an extended letter of invitation from an Indian host.

**For Tourist Visas:**

Tourist visas, also known as traveller's visas, have been created specifically for individuals intending to travel to India for tourism. This includes visiting family and friends, engaging in sightseeing, and experiencing India's rich cultural heritage.

**For Business Visas:**

In addition to the standard documents, a business visa application may require the following:
