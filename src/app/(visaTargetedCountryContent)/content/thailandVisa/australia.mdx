## Why Visit Thailand with VisaCollect?

Thailand is a popular destination for Australian travellers who want to experience its stunning beaches, lush jungles, vibrant cities, and rich culture. Whether you want to relax in Phuket, explore Bangkok, or discover Chiang Mai, Thailand has something for everyone. If you are an Australian citizen planning to visit Thailand, you may wonder if you need a visa to enter the country. The answer depends on how long you want to stay and what you want to do in Thailand. In this blog post, we will explain the different visa options for Australian citizens, the requirements and fees, and how to apply for a Thailand eVisa fast and easy with <LinkText text="VisaCollect" href="/"/>.

### What Is Thailand eVisa?

A Thailand eVisa is an electronic visa that allows eligible travellers to visit Thailand for tourism or business purposes. It is a single-entry visa that grants you a maximum stay of 15 days in Thailand. You can apply for a Thailand eVisa online through the official website of the Thai government or through VisaCollect, a trusted and reliable visa service provider. A Thailand eVisa is valid for 30 days from the date of issue, and you can use it to enter Thailand through any of the designated airports or seaports.

#### Do Australian passport holders need Thailand eVisa?

No, Australian passport holders do not need a Thailand eVisa to enter Thailand. Australians can stay in Thailand for up to 15 days visa-free, as long as they have a valid passport with at least six months of validity remaining and a confirmed return or onward ticket. This is called a visa exemption.

##### How To Apply for Thailand eVisa?

Applying for a Thailand eVisa is simple and hassle-free with VisaCollect. You can complete the whole process online in a few minutes, without having to visit a Thai embassy or consulate, or wait in long queues at the airport.

Here are the simple steps to follow:

1. **Visit the VisaCollect website**: Visit the VisaCollect website and select Thailand as your destination country and Australia as your citizenship country.

2. **Choose visa type and entries**: Choose the type of visa you need, either a tourist visa or a business visa, and the number of entries you want, either single or multiple.

3. **Fill out the application form**: Fill out the online application form with your personal and travel information, such as your full name, date of birth, passport number, email address, phone number, arrival date, and departure date.

4. **Pay the visa fee**: Pay the visa fee using a secure payment method, such as a credit card, debit card, or PayPal. The visa fee for Australian citizens is US$30 for a single-entry visa, plus a service fee of US$25 for VisaCollect.

5. **Receive your eVisa**: Receive your Thailand eVisa by email within 24 hours. You can also track the status of your application on the VisaCollect website.

6. **Print and carry**: Finally, print out your Thailand eVisa and carry it with you when you travel to Thailand. You will need to present it along with your passport at the immigration checkpoint.

### Thailand eVisa online application process for Citizens of Australia

The Thailand eVisa online application process for citizens of Australia is the same as the one described above. You can apply for a Thailand eVisa online through the official website of the Thai government or through VisaCollect, a trusted and reliable visa service provider. The online visa application is faster, easier, and cheaper than the traditional visa process.

## Documents Required to Apply for Thailand eVisa from Australia

1. **Valid Australian Passport**: Ensure your passport has at least six months of validity remaining and one blank page for the visa stamp.

2. **Digital Photo**: Provide a recent digital photo that meets specific requirements: taken within the last six months, in colour, with a white background, showing your full face and eyes, without glasses or headwear (except for religious reasons), and in JPEG format.

3. **Valid Email Address**: Provide a valid email address where you will receive your Thailand eVisa.

4. **Payment Method**: Have a valid credit card, debit card, or PayPal account ready to pay the visa fee.

5. **Travel Itinerary**: Prepare a travel itinerary that includes your flight details, hotel reservations, and planned activities in Thailand.

6. **Travel Insurance Policy**: Obtain a travel insurance policy that covers your medical expenses and repatriation in case of an emergency.

#### Types of Thailand eVisa for Australian Citizens?

There are two types of Thailand eVisa for Australian citizens: a tourist visa and a business visa. Both visas are single-entry visas that allow you to stay in Thailand for up to 15 days. The difference between them is the purpose of your visit. A tourist visa is for leisure, sightseeing, or visiting friends and relatives. A business visa is for attending meetings, conferences, or trade fairs.

###### What is the validity of Thailand eVisa for Australian Citizens?

A Thailand eVisa for Australian citizens is valid for 30 days from the date of issue. You can use it to enter Thailand through any of the designated airports or seaports within this period. However, you can only stay in Thailand for up to 15 days. If you want to extend your stay or change your visa type, you will need to apply for a visa extension or a new visa in Thailand.

## What are the requirements for children travelling to Thailand from Australia?

Children travelling to Thailand from Australia need to have a valid passport and a visa, just like adults. They also need to have a travel consent letter from their parents or legal guardians if they are travelling alone or with someone other than their parents or legal guardians. The letter should state the purpose and duration of the trip, the details of the accompanying person, and the contact information of the parents or legal guardians. The letter should also be notarized or certified by a public authority. Additionally, children may need to provide proof of vaccination or recovery from Covid-19, or a negative test result, depending on their age and the current travel restrictions.

### Do Minor Children Need a Tourist E-visa for Thailand?

Yes, minor children need a tourist eVisa for Thailand, just like adults. They also need to have a valid passport and a travel consent letter from their parents or legal guardians if they are travelling alone or with someone other than their parents or legal guardians. The letter should state the purpose and duration of the trip, the details of the accompanying person, and the contact information of the parents or legal guardians. The letter should also be notarized or certified by a public authority. Additionally, children may need to provide proof of vaccination or recovery from Covid-19, or a negative test result, depending on their age and the current travel restrictions.

## Travel Restrictions for Australian Citizens

As of June 1, 2021, the Thai government has implemented new travel restrictions for travellers returning from international travel, including Australian citizens. Here are the current requirements:

- **Fully Vaccinated or Recovered**: Australian citizens who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) or who have recovered from Covid-19 in the last three months do not need to present a negative PCR test or quarantine upon arrival in Thailand. However, they must provide proof of vaccination or recovery, such as a certificate or document issued by the relevant authorities.

- **Unvaccinated or Not Recovered**: Australian citizens who are not vaccinated or recovered must present a negative PCR test taken 72 hours before entering Thailand or a negative rapid antigen test taken 48 hours before entering Thailand. They may also be subjected to a PCR test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days in a designated place. Quarantine can be ended early if they test negative on the 10th day of quarantine.

**Important Note**: Travel restrictions and requirements are subject to change, so it's essential for Australian citizens to check the latest updates before travelling to Thailand.

### Is VisaCollect Safe for applying for a Thailand eVisa for the Australian citizens?

VisaCollect is an online visa service provider that claims to offer fast and easy visa applications for various countries, including Thailand. However, I cannot verify the reliability or safety of this website, as there are no reviews or ratings available from other users or experts. Therefore, I would advise you to exercise caution and do your own research before using this website. Alternatively, you can apply for a Thailand eVisa directly from the official website of the Thai government, which is more secure and trustworthy.

##### What happens after applying for a Thailand eVisa from Australia?

After applying for a Thailand eVisa from Australia, you will receive an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) by email within 24 hours, according to one source2. The ETA will contain your application ID, visa number, and visa validity. You will need to print out the ETA and carry it with you when you travel to Thailand. You will also need to present your passport and the ETA at the immigration checkpoint in Thailand, where the eVisa will be stamped on your passport. You can use the eVisa to enter Thailand through any of the designated airports or seaports.
