In this blog post, we will explain the different visa options for Canadian citizens, the requirements and fees, and how to apply for a Thailand eVisa with <LinkText text="VisaCollect" href="/"/> at speed.

### What Is Thailand eVisa?

A Thailand eVisa is an electronic visa that allows eligible travelers to visit Thailand for tourism or business purposes. It is a single-entry visa that grants you a maximum stay of 15 days in Thailand. You can apply for a Thailand eVisa online through the official website of the Thai government or through VisaCollect, a trusted and reliable visa service provider. A Thailand eVisa is valid for 30 days from the date of issue, and you can use it to enter Thailand through any of the designated airports or seaports.

#### Do Canadian passport holders need Thailand eVisa?

No, Canadian passport holders do not need a Thailand eVisa to enter Thailand. Canadians can stay in Thailand for up to 15 days visa-free, as long as they have a valid passport with at least six months of validity remaining and a confirmed return or onward ticket. This is called a visa exemption.

4. **Pay the visa fee**: Use a secure payment method, such as a credit card, debit card, or PayPal, to pay the visa fee. The fee for Canadian citizens is $40.48 CAD for a single-entry visa, plus a service fee of $37.99 CAD for VisaCollect.

## What Documents Are Required to Apply for Thailand eVisa from Canada?

### Types of Thailand eVisa for Canadian Citizens

There are two types of Thailand eVisa for Canadian citizens: a tourist visa and a business visa. Both visas are single-entry visas that allow you to stay in Thailand for up to 15 days. The difference between them is the purpose of your visit. A tourist visa is for leisure, sightseeing, or visiting friends and relatives. A business visa is for attending meetings, conferences, or trade fairs.

#### What is the validity of Thailand eVisa for Canadian Citizens?

A Thailand eVisa for Canadian citizens is valid for 30 days from the date of issue. You can use it to enter Thailand through any of the designated airports or seaports within this period. However, you can only stay in Thailand for up to 15 days. If you want to extend your stay or change your visa type, you will need to apply for a visa extension or a new visa in Thailand.
