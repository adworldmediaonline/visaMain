## Apply for Turkey Visa Now and Enjoy Your Journey to Its Fullest!

Canadian citizens intending to visit Turkey for tourism or business-related purposes can obtain an electronic visa (e-Visa). The advantage of the e-Visa is that it eliminates the need for a visit to a government embassy or consulate and long waiting lines. With Turkey's e-Visa approval, Canadian travelers can stay in the country for up to 90 days.

An approved Turkey e-Visa can be used for single or multiple entries into the country. However, Canadian citizens wishing to reside in Turkey for work or study require a different type of visa that must be obtained by applying at a Turkish government office or embassy in their home country. If they wish to stay in Turkey for more than 90 days for business or leisure purposes, they are obliged to obtain a long-term visa instead of an e-Visa.

### What is a Turkey e-Visa?

The e-Visa is an authorization document that allows visitors to enter Turkey.

**Requirements to avail a valid Turkey eVisa:**

Canada is one of the 100 countries whose citizens are allowed to apply for and receive a Turkish e-Visa online without visiting an embassy or consulate. The Turkish government requires that Canadian travelers meet the Turkey e-Visa requirements before applying for a Turkish e-Visa to ensure a smooth application process. These requirements include:

- A passport with at least 150 days of validity from the arrival date in Turkey.
- A valid email address.
- Valid Credit/MasterCard information.

Canadian citizens should ensure that their passports have the necessary validity before making plans to travel to Turkey. Travelers from Canada should consider renewing their passports before they start the application process to ensure they will have the necessary validity to enter Turkey. Travelers may need to plan their trip to Turkey early to account for the time needed to renew their passports.

#### What are the Processing Times for Turkey e-Visa?

Evisamart aims to meet the needs of every applicant consistently. Therefore, you can choose one of the three available options when it comes to processing time:

- **Standard process:** Your application will be processed in 48 hours. This is an ideal choice for travelers who are not in a hurry.

- **Urgent process:** If you need your application much faster, you can choose this option. Your e-visa will arrive in your email inbox within 12 hours.

- **Rush processing:** If you need to travel as soon as possible, this is the ideal option. Your visa will be processed in just 30 minutes.

### How Does the Turkey e-Visa Work?

In April 2013, the Turkish government launched a simple online visa system that issues an e-Visa instead of the old "sticker visa". Once the information and payment are submitted, the visa is emailed to the traveler and must be downloaded and printed. The e-Visa should be shown to the airport and customs officials in Turkey and kept safe for the remaining duration. The e-Visa means not going to local embassies or waiting in line at the airport to obtain a visa.

#### How Long is the Turkey e-Visa Valid For?

The Turkey e-Visa is valid for 180 days after arrival and allows Multiple Entry for a maximum stay of 90 days in total.

## How Long Does it Take to Apply for a Turkey e-Visa?

Less than 10 minutes. We will handle the rest, and we will notify you of the status of the application by email immediately.

###### What Happens After I Have Applied?

Once the application is made, you will receive your Turkey e-Visa by email. There's no need to deal with the embassy or consulate visit. We handle it for you, so you don't lose valuable time. Next, present a printed copy of your e-Visa along with your passport once you enter Turkey.

**How Can I Apply for My Family or Friends?**

Applying for family or friends is as simple as applying for yourself. You just need to make sure you have all the necessary details at hand. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Gather Information:** Collect all the required information from your family members or friends. This includes their passport details, email address, and Credit/MasterCard information.

2. **Start the Application:** Click on ‘apply here’ and fill out the application form with the collected information.

3. **Submit and Wait:** After filling out the form, submit it and wait for the e-Visa to arrive in the email inbox. The processing time depends on the option you choose - Standard, Urgent, or Rush.

**Note:** Each individual visiting Turkey needs a separate e-Visa, even if they are minors. So, if you are applying for a family or a group, you need to apply for each member separately.

**Remember:**
