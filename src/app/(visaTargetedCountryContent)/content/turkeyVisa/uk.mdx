## Plan your trip to Turkey with VisaCollect’s Lightning-fast Visa Application Process

Travellers from the UK planning a visit to Turkey, including UK citizens, usually require a visa to enter the country. For UK passport holders, obtaining a Turkey visa involves meeting specific requirements, such as possessing a valid visa or resident permit from the US, UK, Ireland, or Schengen countries.

While the process of securing a Turkey visa for UK citizens is generally straightforward, it's crucial to be aware that eligibility criteria, rules, and guidelines may vary based on the purpose of the visit.

Understanding the nuances of Turkey's visa system is essential, given that rules for Business and Tourist visas may differ from those for Education and Work visits. It's imperative for individuals planning to visit Turkey to familiarize themselves with the comprehensive visa system of the country.

**Note:** Turkey's visa rules may undergo changes based on international standards. To provide a clearer understanding, the entire process of obtaining a Turkey visa for UK citizens is explained below.

### How to Apply for Turkish e Visa for UK citizens?

For the citizens of the UK to secure a Turkey e-Visa, the process involves filling out the Turkey e-Visa application form, providing personal details, and passport information. This applies to both business and tourist visas.

UK tourists are required to furnish essential details such as given and family names, date and place of birth, passport number, passport issue and expiry date, email address, contact number, and supporting documents (valid visa or resident licence from the US/UK/Ireland/Schengen).

#### What is VisaCollect?

VisaCollect is a global eVisa service provider that simplifies the online processing of tourist e visas for Turkey, and other countries. This platform allows travellers from various countries to manage visa applications from a computer, smartphone, or tablet with speed, security, minimal chances of rejection, and a dedicated customer support team available **24x7**

### Turkish e-Visa Overview

The Turkish e-Visa is an official document facilitating entry into and travel within Turkey. It serves as an alternative to visas issued at Turkish missions and ports of entry. Applicants from the UK receive their visas electronically after providing required information and making the application fee payment using a credit or debit card (Mastercard or Visa).

##### Maximum Stay Allowed for UK Citizens

UK citizens are permitted a maximum stay of 30 days in Turkey. However, it's essential to note that visitors are not allowed to engage in paid or unpaid work during this period. Those intending to stay longer must apply for a residence permit at the local Police Station in Turkey.

## Processing Times and Prices

Concerns about the cost of electronic visas are addressed with VisaCollect’s offering three processing time options, each determining the cost:

- Standard process (24 to 48 hours)
- Urgent process (within 12 hours)
- Rush process (within 1 hour)

#### How to Apply for Turkish e Visa

1. **Step-1:** Complete the online application and pay the fees with a credit/debit card.

2. **Step-2:** Receive the visa via email, eliminating the need to visit an embassy.

3. **Step-3:** Upon arrival in Turkey, present the passport and the e-Visa provided. The Turkey e-Visa is electronically linked to the passport.

   **A tip:** Print a copy of the Turkish e-Visa in case of any issues with the immigration office's workstations upon arrival.

   **Additional Information for UK Citizens:**

- Each traveller must obtain their own e-Visa.
- Entry into Turkey is permitted at any time within the validity of the e-Visa.

## Validity of Supporting Documents for e Visa to Turkey

Supporting documents should be valid upon entry to Turkey, and recently used or unused single-entry visas are accepted as long as their validity covers the entry date.

##### Extending Stay or Other Visa Types

- For those wishing to stay longer than the e-Visa allows, applying for a residence permit at the local Police Station is necessary.
- It's crucial to note that an e-Visa is issued solely for tourism and business purposes.
- Overstaying the visa may result in fines, deportation, or a ban on future travel to Turkey.
