## Needs for a Visa Based on Nationality

A visa is needed for most people who want to visit Egypt. Of course, there are some exceptions:

## How to Get a Visa Before You Go

To get a visa, people who are not qualified for a visa exemption or a visa on arrival must apply for one ahead of time. Most of the time, this process includes:

### Putting together an application:

Fill out the application form, which you can usually get from the website of the Egyptian embassy or consulate in your home country.

### Getting the Documents You Need:

A valid passport with at least six months left on it, passport-sized photos, a trip itinerary, proof of where you will stay in Egypt, and sometimes proof of money are all things that are usually needed.

### Sending in your application:

You might have to go to an embassy or consulate in person to turn in your application and papers. In some places, you may be able to or have to mail your application.

## Special Things to Think About

### Long-Term Visas:

You will probably need to apply for a certain type of visa if you come to Egypt for a reason other than travel (like work, school, or long-term business projects) or if you plan to stay for more than 30 days.

### Group Travel:

Tourist groups of at least five people may be able to get visas faster or not at all, depending on the circumstances.

### Pre-Clearance:

Because of security or political concerns, people from some countries may need pre-clearance before they can apply for a visa.

## How to Get a Visa Quickly and Easily

### Commence Early:

Start the process of applying for a visa a long time before your trip to allow for any delays.

### Check out the most recent requirements:

Visa rules and requirements are subject to change, so it's best to check with the Egyptian customs authorities or the embassy or consulate closest to you for the most up-to-date information.

To avoid scams or false information, make sure you <LinkText href="/" text="apply for your visa"/> through the official routes.
