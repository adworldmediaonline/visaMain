## Checklist of Important Documents

### Valid Passport:

Your passport is the most important thing you have with you. Please make sure it is authentic, in good shape, and has a soft copy of the first and last pages. Remember that an invalid passport can cause delays or even being turned down.

### Old Passport:

Please show your old passport if you have one. The first and last pages should be soft copies, and they should be in good shape.

### Pictures:

You'll need two new 35x45 mm pictures with a white background, a matte finish, and 80% face covering. Make sure your face is neutral, and don't wear glasses or any other kind of headwear that isn't holy.

### Air Tickets:

Having a travel plan or round-trip airline tickets can help your application by showing that you plan to travel and come back, but they aren't always required before you can get a visa.

### Covering Letter:

This letter should describe your trip in detail, including where you will stay when you will go, and who will pay for it. It's critical that the information in your cover letter matches that in your application.

### Financial Proof:

You need to show proof of your stable income, such as bank statements with a suitable balance, income tax returns from the last three years, and any other financial documents. These papers are very important to show that you have enough money to stay in Australia.

### Proof of Employment:

If you have a job, you may need to show a letter from your boss, your pay stubs, and your ID card. If you are self-employed, you need to show business paperwork and tax reports.

### Health Insurance:

Travel health insurance isn't always necessary, but it can be helpful to have in case of an emergency while you're away.

### Proof of Where You Will Stay:

A hotel reservation or a letter from a host in Australia can be used as proof of where you will stay.

### Character and Health Certificates:

Depending on your application, you may need to show proof that you are not a criminal and that you are healthy.

## Criteria for Eligibility

### Be a Real Traveller:

You should have a good reason for going and plan to go back to your home country when your trip is over.

### Ties to home country that are strong:

Proof of a job, family, or land that will allow you to come back.

### Health Record:

You should be in good health and not have any crime records. The Australian government sets health standards.

### Fees for Visas:

The fee for a Visitor visa (subclass 600) changes, but it's usually around 7700 INR. These fees might change, so always look at the most up-to-date information.
